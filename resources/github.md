### Best Practices

1. **Always be in the correct directory:**
   - Use `pwd` to check your current directory.
   - Use `cd` to navigate to the correct repository directory before running git commands.

2. **Fetch or Pull Before Starting New Work:**
   - Start your work session with a `git fetch` or `git pull`.

3. **Commit Local Changes Before Pulling:**
   - Use `git status` to check for uncommitted changes.
   - Commit changes with `git commit -am "Your commit message"` before pulling.

4. **Use `git status` Frequently:**
   - Run `git status` before and after operations to stay informed about your repository state.

5. **Resolve Conflicts:**
   - If conflicts occur during a pull, resolve them in your text editor.
   - After resolving, use `git add` to stage the resolved files and `git commit` to complete the merge.

Remember to replace `main` with your default branch name if it's different, and adjust commands as necessary for your specific Repo_majik workflow.
